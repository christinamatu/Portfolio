my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? It is trying to count the numbers between 1 through "20"
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? When the number reaches 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? That it will reach 20

# change the range to 1:21 since python code emits the last number
